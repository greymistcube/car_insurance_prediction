# Prediction of Normalized Losses of Insured vehicles via Neural Network

Normalized loss is defined as the relative average loss payment per insured
vehicle year normalized for all autos within a particular size classification.

As for the model used, we use multi-layered perceptron (MLP). Detailed
discussion is annotated in the main file.

The dataset is taken from the
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile).
